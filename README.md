# Battleship

## Overview

This project is a modern, web-based implementation of the classic Battleship game. It includes both a 2-player mode and a challenging single-player mode against a smart computer opponent.

## Key Features

- 2-Player Mode:
  - Players take turns by passing the device (e.g., spinning the monitor or passing the laptop).
  - A “Pass Device” alert allows buffer time for players during the turn handoff.
- Single-Player Mode:
  - Intelligent AI that targets adjacent slots after scoring a “hit” for a more challenging experience.
- Responsive design:
  - Works seamlessly on laptops, desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Typescript was used for the game interface and core interactions. Tailwind and CSS were used for styling and layout. Jest was used to write basic unit tests for the game logic in Javascript. Bundled with webpack.
